This project is a streamlit app that will allow the user to generate (small) Travelling Salesperson Problems and 
solve them using a variety of algorithms. The app will also display the solution on a map. 

## Todo


1. Add a generate instance button and write instance coordinates to the screen
1. Make the function input to the number of cities
1. Write a function to calculate the distance matrix and display it on the screen
1. Plot the instance on a map
1. Make a solve button for the greedy algorithm 
1. Display the solution on the map
1. Add option for exact algorithm and solve using it 
1. Display two solutions on the map simultaneously
1. Combine the two solution buttons into one with a select box for the algorithm
1. Add linting, formatting and pytest
