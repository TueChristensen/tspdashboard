This project is a streamlit app that will allow the user to generate (small) Travelling Salesperson Problems and 
solve them using a variety of algorithms. The app will also display the solution on a map. 

## Todo


1. Make a solve button for the greedy algorithm and add algorithm
1. Display the solution on the map
1. Add option for exact algorithm and solve using it 
1. Display two solutions on the map simultaneously
1. Combine the two solution buttons into one with a select box for the algorithm
